# mysql

This is a test vesion of DB for small online store. I created it using MySQL Workbench.

The query 'amount_of_money' returns the total amount of money spent by a customer for all orders.

The query 'most_sold_categories' retrieves the most sold categories.

The query 'percentage' returns the discount (percent from price) offered by the promo_price. for example, 15% or -15% if promo_price is bigger.

The query 'promo_price_bigger_than_price' returns all the products that have promo_price bigger than price.

The query 'quantities' returns the total quantities of products ordered.

The queries that begin with the word 'inserting' insert data in all tables.

Later I will develop the project by adding functionality.
